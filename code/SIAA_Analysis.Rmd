## Importing Data.

### @Sri I've pulled all the relevant coordinate data from the original raw data file, and saved that for our visualizations. To preserve anonymity, we should probably remove the coordinates from the original raw CSV now that we have the spatial outputs. If anyone follows my process, they could easily pull address data from the raw coordinate data. Because of this, I have removed all the coordinate information from the below raw input. I also comment out all of the code relating to the coordinate scraping, and we won't upload the coordinate file to our GitHub. Also, I only scraped information down to the city level to ensure no PII is revealed in the interactive tools. Exception is for students, where we have their universities. I've also removed IP addresses. Let me know if this rationale doesn't make sense.

### PLEASE NOTE: ALL CODE IS COMMENTED OUT AND THE INPUTS HAVE BEEN CLEANED OF COORDINATE DATA TO ENSURE ANONYMITY OF RESPONDENTS. THIS CODE SIMPLY DESCRIBES THE PROCESS USED TO SCRAPE LOCATION DATA AND CREATE OUR SPATIAL OUTPUTS. USERS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RECREATE THESE FIGURES.

# Our geocoding process is as follows. 

## FOR PARENTS
# First, we use the revgeocode function to return location information for latitude & longitude. To preserve anonymity, we only return the city & state of the coordinates. If the state returned matches the value of the state_of_residence value, we use the new coordinates. Otherwise, we replace the raw coordinates as missing.

## FOR STUDENTS
# For students, we manually scrape (using Google Maps) coordinate information for the university attended of the student. These new coordinate values replace the raw coordinate values. If a university for the student is not provided, the raw coordinates are replaced as missing.

# First, I read in the new coordinate data. This has all of the manually scraped student coordinates, rather than the raw coordinates, but still has the original parent coordinates.
# combined_SIAA_coords <- read_csv("/Users/sameernair-desai/Desktop/combined_SIAA_coords.csv")

# parent_coords$country_check <- ""
